- Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the sorted portion of the array.
- Merge Sort: Divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted subarrays to produce the final sorted array.
